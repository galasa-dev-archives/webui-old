# Landing page

The landing page is the first page you will arrive at in the Galasa WebUI, it is the hub of navigation around the site.
There are no specific components on this page, however, we have used some carbon components

### Carbon Components Used:

* ibmGrid - This is used to align items of the page. We use the [2x Grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation/) system.
* Clickable tile - These act as clickable areas that are used to navigate to different areas of the UI
